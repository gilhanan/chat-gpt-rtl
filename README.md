# ChatGPT RTL Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the usability of ChatGPT for users who communicate using right-to-left (RTL) scripts. The extension automatically detects RTL characters and adjusts the direction of the DOM elements accordingly, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for RTL languages. Ideal for users who interact with languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu, and others that require RTL orientation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/chatgpt-rtl.git
cd chatgpt-rtl
```

Then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Building the Extension

You can build the extension by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a `dist` directory with the built extension and a `extension.zip` file that you can upload to the Chrome Web Store.

## Developing the Extension

If you want to develop the extension and have webpack automatically rebuild any changes, you can run:

```bash
npm run watch
```
